## Asking Questions

When working on a piece of code, you may sometimes encounter a problem that you try to figure out on your own, but you cannot seem to find the answer for. When this is the case, you may end up going on the internet to ask questions about your problem. Now the question is, should you ask smart questions? Is it important for people like software engineers to ask smart questions? Or are stupid questions good enough?

### The Smart Question

When thinking about smart questions, you want to make sure how your question is presented and answered is efficient and effective. An example of what I think is a smart question is taken from [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23667086/why-is-my-variable-unaltered-after-i-modify-it-inside-of-a-function-asynchron).

The question asked is about why a variable is undefined when it is modified inside a function. I find this question to be smart because it does not just ask what causes the issue, but the person asking wants to know why it is happening. Asking about why such event is happening can bring people who answers your problem not just give you a short answer, but a detailed one. In this question, one person who answered first gave a short answer as to what kind of problem it is, but they go into details into why it is happening. Getting the details into why this issue occurs can help you understand more about the issue and can help you troubleshoot similar problems in the future.

### The Stupid Question

When it comes to stupid questions, it can depend on how and where you ask it and what kind of answer you will be expecting with the question. One question that I found from [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65930908/how-long-does-it-take-for-google-play-developer-support-team-to-respond) shows what a stupid question can be. When asking questions on Stack Overflow, the main topics of these questions are normally about programming, but with the stupid question I am referring to, it is not a question about programming and is off-topic. It can be easily clear as to why this may come off as a stupid question because this question is posted where it should not be. For that reason, you may not get the right people to assist you with your question since the site is mainly used for programming questions and some may not be experienced with the question that is off-topic. Someone who answered this question mentioned that it is indeed off-topic and redirected the person asking the question to a link explaining about what is considered on-topic. This makes it so the person asking the question needs to post their question elsewhere and does not answer his question in the end.

## Smart or Stupid

So, after covering over an example for a smart and stupid question, is it important for software engineers to ask smart questions? Or are stupid question just enough? In the end, asking smart questions as a software engineer should be the way to go. The reason for this is because if you want to improve yourself as a software engineer, you would want to know the details of your problem, instead of just having yes or no answers and just take the answer at face value without understanding why it is the solution to your problem. You may come across similar problems, and you will probably ask a similar question again with another similar answer because you did not ask a smart question where someone who answers it gives you details on why it is occuring. You can then apply on what can cause the issues for future troubleshooting and help you improve the quality of your program. Seeing both what a smart and stupid question can be, I want to make sure that I ask smart questions when I can to improve the quality of the answers I get and improve myself. That being said, stupid questions may not always be bad because maybe you're not a software engineer and you may not care about the details of what your program is doing and just want it to work. Both smart and stupid questions can have their purposes, and whatever type of question you ask, just think about your question, and what you want to expect the answers to the question to be, may it be a yes or no answer or a detailed answer.
