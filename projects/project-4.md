This project was to design a website where people of the UH community could trade or sell objects to other community members. Example would be one student wanting to sell a used textbook to another student. In the website, you can shop for objects listed by other members of the community and see if they are planning to sell or trade the product that is listed. The information of the person putting the product on the shopping page is shown so you can communicate with them on how to sell or trade.

How I contributed to this project was mainly working on the product page and some database related problems in order to get data to show up properly for the site. From working on this project, I was able to realize firsthand how difficult it can be to initially start your group going to work on a project, but once everyone is comfortable and setup, the process of working on the project feels much faster.
