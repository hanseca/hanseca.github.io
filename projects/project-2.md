The purpose of this project was to design a discord bot in JavaScript to automate actions for public servers. When Discord was still pretty new to the internet, it did not have as much functionality as it does now currently. This was to improve the user experience for users joining public servers.

Example actions the bot would do is welcoming new users to the server with a customized message and automatically assigning them roles. Creating personal alarms by using certain commands with the bot was also implemented if a user needed a reminder or alarm and want the bot to notify them through a DM instead of messaging them through the server. You could also create a message with the alarms so the bot will DM you the message you wrote to the bot before to remind you what you needed it for exactly. The bot could also be commanded to create customized messages for when a user leaves a server, as well as reporting other events like joining voice chat or leaving it and user moving to another different voice chat in the server. It could also directly DM users instead of a welcome channel with a customized message when they join as well as notifying the user if they got kicked from the server from the bot, and if the person issuing the kick wants to, a customized message for the reason for the kick through the DM. A feature the bot had was displaying its status and reporting through its status if it is under maintenance or currently running into issues.

Working on this project gave me one of the first experiences with working in JavaScript and understanding on how API's work and how to work with them. Also allowed me to get a first glimpse of developing something to enhance a user experience. It had also introduced me to webhooks, but I have not gone far with webhooks, but I now know how they work.

The code provided through the link is not the final product of the bot I designed years ago as I have lost the data for them. These are what I could find and are the early stages of the bot development.
