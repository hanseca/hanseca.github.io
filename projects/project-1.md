The final project for ICS 212 was to develop an encryption algorithm based off of SHA-1 documentations and test it on files with random messages in it. It would essentially take a file and run the encryption algorithm and output a message digest in a separate text file. The language used to develop this project is C++.

This final project was done on your own, but was given half a semester to work on it. When the project was given, you needed to read the documentation given for the project on how SHA-1 was done, and use either C or C++ to develop it. Some of the key things for the algorithm to be successful was properly making the bit shift operations do what they are supposed to do to emcrypt, making sure it can properly read the input and output the message digest correctly, and compressing the characters as an int from the file into a message array.
