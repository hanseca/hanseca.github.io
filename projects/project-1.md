The final project for ICS 212 was to develop an encryption algorithm based off of SHA-1 documentations and test it on files with random messages in it. It would essentially take a file and run the encryption algorithm and output a message digest in a separate text file. The language used to develop this project is C++.

This final project was done on your own, but was given half a semester to work on it. When the project was given, you needed to read the documentation given for the project on how SHA-1 was done, and use either C or C++ to develop it. Some of the key things for the algorithm to be successful was properly making the bit shift operations do what they are supposed to do to encrypt the file, making sure it can properly read the file and output the message digest correctly, and compressing the characters as an int from the file into a message array. When the project was first assigned, I had a feeling that it would be tough for me at the time and was told that I should at least have an idea on how to create the algorithm. I did not do what was suggested and put the project off until the last two weeks of the semester. When that time came around, classmates started asking me on how I was doing with the project as they had not actually started working on the project yet, but they were already making plans on paper on how it may be made. At this time, I knew that I had to start, but yet I still have not. I only just read the documentation at this point. Finally, towards the last 3 days before the project was due, I knew I had to work on it now and get something done before it was due. After spending two full days dedicated to working through trial and error, referring back to past assignments in C++, I was able to create the algorithm. Originally, the algorithm worked for most tests, but it had issues when dealing with the biggest file in the test. At this point, I had another day left to work on the algorithm and I was in a sort of adrenaline rush working on this project. I pushed through and decided to fix what was wrong and the algorithm. At least from my test, the algorithm was outputting the message digest exactly as it should be.

Something I can take away from this project was that in a way, holding it off until the last 3 days from its due date pushed me to focus on the project with a lot of focus to just finish to the point that I was able to get it perfect. On the other hand, the idea of holding off a project until it's last few days from due date is not the smartest idea because if I did not somehow solved creating the algorithm, I would have definitely failed the project. The process of working on the project itself in a way was a breeze. It's development was the culmination of all the C++ assignments done throughout the second half of the semester, and referring to those assignments, I was able to create the core of the algorithm without major problems. I feel that referring to previous C++ assignments while developing the algorithm is something important to do to help give ideas on how something should be made. As for having issues at the end with bigger file in testing, the trial and error took half a day, but the feeling of being able to fix it with a day left before due date was refreshing and gives me a feeling that I can push myself to do things I thought was not possible, in this case, creating the algorithm to perform exactly what it does without any bugs within 3 days when it was assigned for half a semester.
