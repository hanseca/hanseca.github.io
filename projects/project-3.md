This pokemon game was designed to be like Pokemon Go where you can catch pokemon using Java. You could have pokemon you had captured stored into your backpack. The purpose of this game was to show everything learned in ICS 211.

This game had to be designed on your own and needed to have Java GUI. Even though this had to be done on your own, this was building upon assignments done in ICS 211 where you were creating small individual files for the game like the pokemon data. 

Working on this game required me to understand everything that has been taught throughout ICS 211, and not being able to apply everything taught would result in small bugs all over the game. With the development of the game, it becomes clear with the differences Java has with JavaScript like classes. One of the key things about Java that had to be utilized in this game was class hierachy and inheritance for pokemon data. This game also helped me to develop my coding style like the placement of the brackets and indents to make the code look nice. This was due to the lines of code in the game as well as multiple files. Without developing my coding style, I would probably had a much harder time going over and reviewing my code if a bug would ever occur and would slow me down.
