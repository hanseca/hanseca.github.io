## The Start

When I first started working with code, one of the first things I noticed was the coding standards that people would use online and from those who teach programming languages. I quickly picked up the coding standard I use today that I learned from those who initially taught me how to code. The coding standard introduced to me was very easy to grasp as it made sense to me. What I mean by this is that the standards are there so it is more consistent when you look at another code and easier to look at. I could not imagine how coding would be if there was no standard and code blocks and indents were all over the lines.

## In Comes ESLint and IntelliJ

When I started taking a software engineering course, it has been about two or more years since my last course that involved working on code. For that reason, I knew that I was going to be rusty, but the coding standard I learned still stuck with me and helped me deal with the rust over the years. Later on in the course, IntelliJ and ESLint were to be used for the majority of the time, and ESLint brought it's code standard. As I am typing this, it has been about a week since ESLint has been installed with IntelliJ, and to be honest, I feel that almost every error I am coming across with ESLint is not how I am formatting my code, but because of my familiarity with IntelliJ.

### The New Environment

When I initially installed IntelliJ, I thought it was going to feel the same as me using jGRASP or Vim, both which I had used previously for other courses and personal uses. It turned out not to be the case. One of the key things that IntelliJ does differently from my observation compared to jGRASP or Vim was that it will automatically indent for you when going to the next line depending on the scope. This was not the case before, so whenever I created a new line, I would habitually press tab on my keyboard to indent. Since IntelliJ does this for me, I kept having extra indents on my lines and I would get errors from ESLint telling me that I have extra space.
